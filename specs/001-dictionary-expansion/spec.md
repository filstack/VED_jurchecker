## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
The JurChecker service needs to improve entity detection recall by automatically expanding entity names into multiple searchable variants during dictionary compilation. When an entity entry (person name or organization) is loaded from the CSV registry, the system should generate multiple alias forms to match how entities might be mentioned in real Russian legal texts‚Äîincluding different name orders, initials, diminutive forms, transliterations, morphological case variants, and normalized punctuation.

This expansion happens **offline during dictionary build time**, not at query time, ensuring no performance impact on the production search API.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a person entity "–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–π –ê–Ω–∞—Ç–æ–ª—å–µ–≤–∏—á –ù–∞–≤–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π" in the registry, **When** the dictionary is compiled, **Then** the system generates aliases including:
   - Name order variants: "–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–π –ù–∞–≤–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π", "–ù–∞–≤–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–π"
   - Initial variants: "–ê. –ù–∞–≤–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π", "–ù–∞–≤–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ê.", "–ê.–ê. –ù–∞–≤–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π", "–ù–∞–≤–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–π –ê.–ê."
   - Morphological forms: "–ù–∞–≤–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–≥–æ", "–ù–∞–≤–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–º—É", "–ù–∞–≤–∞–ª—å–Ω—ã–º", "–ù–∞–≤–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ–º"
   - Transliteration: "Navalny", "Alexey Navalny", "A. Navalny"
   - Normalized punctuation: all variants with spaces normalized from sequences of `[\s\.\-]+`

2. **Given** an entity with diminutive name forms (e.g., "–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–π"), **When** aliases are expanded, **Then** variants include "–õ—ë—à–∞", "–õ–µ—à–∞", "–ê–ª–µ–∫—Å" generated from petrovich/pymorphy3 name dictionaries

3. **Given** an entity name containing "—ë" characters, **When** aliases are generated, **Then** both "—ë" and "–µ" normalized variants are included in the automaton

4. **Given** a person's surname, **When** morphological expansion is applied, **Then** the system uses pymorphy3/pymorphy2 to generate all Russian case forms (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, prepositional)

5. **Given** a rare or foreign surname that morphological analyzer cannot process, **When** expansion occurs, **Then** the system applies heuristic suffixes (-–æ–≥–æ, -–æ–º—É, -—ã–º, -–æ–º) as fallback variants and logs a warning for manual review

### Edge Cases
- When morphological analyzer fails, system applies heuristic suffixes and logs warnings for manual review queue
- How does the system handle names that are already in non-standard order or contain unusual punctuation?
- How should the system handle names with non-standard romanizations already present in source documents?
- How should the system handle entity names with more than 3 parts (e.g., compound surnames or multiple given names)?
- System enforces maximum of 100 generated aliases per entity to prevent dictionary explosion

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

**Name Order & Initials**
- **FR-001**: System MUST generate both "FirstName LastName" and "LastName FirstName" variants for person names
- **FR-002**: System MUST generate initial variants: "I. LastName", "LastName I." (single initial)
- **FR-003**: System MUST generate patronymic initial variants: "I.P. LastName", "LastName I.P." (first + patronymic initials)
- **FR-004**: System MUST preserve original full name as one of the aliases

**Diminutive Forms**
- **FR-005**: System MUST expand common Russian first names into diminutive variants using petrovich or pymorphy3 name dictionaries (e.g., –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–π ‚Üí –õ—ë—à–∞, –õ–µ—à–∞, –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å)

**Transliteration**
- **FR-006**: System MUST generate Latin transliteration variants for Russian names using simplified phonetic transliteration (prioritizing English readability, e.g., –Æ—Ä–∏–π ‚Üí Yuri)
- **FR-007**: System MUST generate transliterated initial variants (e.g., "A. Navalny", "Alexey Navalny")

**Text Normalization**
- **FR-008**: System MUST normalize all sequences of spaces, dots, and hyphens `[\s\.\-]+` to a single space when generating alias keys
- **FR-009**: System MUST convert "—ë" to "–µ" for all generated aliases

- **FR-013a**: System MUST log warnings with entity details when heuristic fallback is applied, enabling manual review queue generation

**Cache & Performance**
- **FR-014**: System MUST include all expanded aliases in the pickle-cached Aho-Corasick automaton

- **FR-016**: Alias expansion MUST NOT impact query-time performance (all expansion at build time)
- **FR-016a**: System MUST limit generated aliases to maximum 100 per entity to prevent dictionary explosion
- **FR-016b**: When alias limit is reached, system MUST log warning with entity ID and prioritize most common variant types (order: original, case forms, initials, diminutives, transliterations)
- **FR-016c**: Dictionary build time (CSV load through automaton finalization and caching) MUST complete within 2 minutes

**Logging & Observability**
- **FR-017**: System MUST log the count of generated aliases per entity at INFO level during dictionary build
- **FR-018**: System MUST log warnings with entity ID and name when morphological analysis fails and heuristic fallback is applied
- **FR-019**: System MUST log total dictionary size (unique alias count) and total build time after expansion
- **FR-020**: System MUST aggregate fallback warnings to enable manual review queue generation
- **FR-021**: System MUST log performance warning if dictionary build exceeds 90 seconds (approaching 2-minute limit)

### Key Entities

- **Entity**: Core registry entry with `id`, `name`, `type`, and existing `aliases` (JSON array from CSV)
- **Alias Variant**: Generated searchable form of entity name (e.g., initial form, case form, transliteration)
- **Morphological Form**: Russian case variant of a surname (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, instrumental, prepositional)
- **Diminutive Mapping**: Relationship between formal first name and its diminutive forms sourced from petrovich/pymorphy3 dictionaries (e.g., –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å–µ–π ‚Üí [–õ—ë—à–∞, –õ–µ—à–∞, –ê–ª–µ–∫—Å])
- **Transliteration Rule**: Mapping between Cyrillic and Latin character representations using simplified phonetic approach for English readability
